INFORMATION
REFUND POLICY
In order to proceed with your refund, return or exchange request. A video of the defective product or a picture of the wrong received product will be necessary. Without any proof, the request will not be processed.
Returns
Returns are subject to Estaderma Refunds Policy.
Refund intent must be indicated within 30 days of receiving your product. If 30 days have elapsed since the purchase, unfortunately, we cannot offer a refund or exchange.
To be eligible for a return, the item must be unused and in the same condition that you received it. It must also be unsealed in the original packaging.
To complete your return, we require a receipt or proof of purchase. Without this proof, any return or refund will be warranted.
Please do not send the purchase back to the manufacturer.
Refunds
A refund request should be made within 30 days of receiving the product. After this period, unfortunately, we cannot offer a refund or exchange.
Once the returned product is received and inspected, we will send you an email to notify you that we have received your returned item. We will also notify you of the approval or rejection of your refund.
If the application is approved, the refund will be made through a wire transfer. Please, take in mind that this transaction might take a few days to be completed.
Refund due to a package seized in customs.
In this case, the refund will be processed excluding the shipping fee.
The shipping fee or free shipping (provided by Estaderma to customers who order more than 300 USD) is a service that covers the shipping cost from our company to the customer. However, if the package has to be returned, the return fee from the courier service’s facility/customs to Estaderma is not included. Due to that circumstance, the return fee will be deducted at the moment of the refund.
Refund processed through bank deposit (Payment completed through TransferWise)
As Transfer Wise is not available for sending remittances in South Korea a direct bank transfer will be executed to refund the customer’s payment. However, notice that in this case 15% of the amount will be deducted from the original amount due to commissions and exchange rates.
Late or missing refunds
If the refund has been received yet, first check your bank account again; then, contact your credit card company, there may be a processing time before a refund is posted.
If you’ve done all of this and you still have not received your refund yet, please contact us at info@estaderma.com.
Sale items
Only regular-priced items are subject to a refund. Unfortunately, sale items or products purchased during the sale period cannot be refunded.
Exchanges
We only replace items if they are defective or damaged. If you need to exchange it for the same item, send us an email at info@estaderma.com and send your item to Estaderma.
Gifts
If the item was marked as a gift when purchased and shipped directly to you, you’ll receive a gift point for the value of your return. Once the returned item is received, a gift certificate will be mailed to you.
If the item wasn’t marked as a gift when purchased, or the gift giver had the order shipped to themselves to give to you later, we will send a refund to the gift giver, and he will find out about your return.
Shipping
To return your product, you should mail the product to Estaderma.
The customer will be responsible for paying for your shipping costs for returning your item. Shipping costs are non-refundable. If you receive a refund, the cost of return shipping will be deducted from your refund.
