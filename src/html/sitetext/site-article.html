The Best Korean PLLA Fillers ( Juvelook, Mennus, Olidia…)
Blog
Poly-L-Lactic Acid (PLLA) fillers have revolutionized the field of aesthetic medicine, offering an effective solution for restoring volume and contours to the face. As demand for minimally invasive cosmetic procedures continues to rise, PLLA fillers have become a preferred choice among patients and practitioners alike, thanks to their biocompatibility and ability to stimulate collagen production.
PLLA fillers can be set apart from traditional hyaluronic acid-based injectables. Rather than adding volume through hydration, PLLA fillers work by stimulating the body’s natural collagen production to gradually restore lost volume and improve skin texture over time. All of these features make PLLA fillers an attractive option for those seeking natural, long-lasting results.
Many PLLA filler brands have earned acclaim for their commitment to quality, safety, and innovation. However, navigating the diverse landscape of PLLA fillers requires an understanding of each brand’s unique characteristics, including particle size, concentration, and duration. In this article, we will explore the intricacies of PLLA fillers and list our favorite brands. Join us as we dive into the world of PLLA fillers to uncover the secrets to youthful skin.
What Are PLLA Fillers?
PLLA fillers consist of biocompatible and biodegradable polymers derived from lactic acid. Once injected into the skin, these microparticles act like a scaffold, triggering cellular responses that result in the production of new collagen fibers. The gradual breakdown of PLLA over time is accompanied by an increase in collagen, leading to skin firmness, elasticity, and volume. This unique mechanism of action sets PLLA fillers apart from other cosmetic injections, offering natural-looking results that evolve over several months.
Despite their advantages, it is important to note that PLLA fillers require careful consideration to achieve optimal outcomes. Thorough assessment of the patient’s facial anatomy and consideration of the precise injection technique are essential for ensuring natural results and minimizing the risk of complications. By understanding the unique properties and mechanisms of PLLA fillers, both practitioners and patients can make safer decisions regarding PLLA injections.
How To Use PLLA Fillers
Injecting PLLA fillers is a nuanced process that requires a thorough understanding of facial anatomy, injection techniques, and product characteristics. Mastering the art of injecting PLLA fillers entails meticulous attention to detail and adherence to best practices to ensure optimal outcomes and patient satisfaction. This is why it is always recommended that PLLA fillers be injected by a medical professional.
There are also specific areas where the use of PLLA may not be appropriate, such as lip augmentation. While PLLA fillers excel at volumizing and contouring larger facial regions, such as the cheeks and jaw, they are not recommended for smaller and more delicate areas of the face, such as the lips.
Additionally, injecting PLLA fillers close to the eyes is typically not recommended. Fine lines and wrinkles around the eyes are often better addressed with treatments like neuromodulators (i.e., Botox) or hyaluronic acid-based fillers for delicate areas.
Similarly, fine lines around the mouth, such as perioral lines or smoker’s lines, may not be effectively treated with PLLA. Alternative treatments, like dermal fillers or laser resurfacing, may be more suitable for addressing fine lines around the mouth.
What To Prepare Before An Injection
Before partaking in PLLA injections, it is important to meet with a medical professional in advance to assess your aesthetic goals, medical history, and expectations. Discussing the anticipated timeline for results and potential side effects is crucial for avoiding disappointment. Once you have selected a PLLA filler, many of the preparation steps are based on the following process:
Prepare the skin
: Preparation of the treatment area is essential for a safe injection. Proper cleansing of the skin with an antiseptic solution helps minimize the risk of infection.
Injection
: Using a fine-gauge needle or blunt-tip cannula (depending on the product manufacturer), the filler is then injected into either the deep dermis or subcutaneous tissue layer. The injection should be performed slowly and with steady pressure to ensure even distribution.
Post-Treatment Care
: Proper post-treatment care and monitoring are essential for optimizing outcomes and ensuring patient comfort. Patients should be advised to avoid touching the treatment area for several hours and excessive touching for up to a week. Strenuous exercise and exposure to extreme heat or cold (such as saunas) should also be avoided for up to one week. Common side effects such as swelling, bruising, and redness are possible but should not last longer than a week.
Who Can Use PLLA Fillers?
PLLA fillers, while offering benefits for many, may not be suitable for everyone. Please read the following information carefully to make sure you are a suitable patient for PLLA injections.
Among those not suited for a PLLA injection are individuals with (current) oral herpes or similar infections. This precaution is taken to avoid exacerbating existing conditions and to prevent complications during the healing process.
Individuals with uncontrolled diabetes are also not ideal candidates. Diabetes can affect the body’s ability to heal properly, increasing the risk of adverse reactions and compromising treatment outcomes. Similarly, patients with blood-clotting may be advised against PLLA to mitigate the risk of excessive bleeding or hematoma formation at the injection sites.
Individuals with autoimmune disorders such as lupus or other connective tissue disorders may not be suitable candidates. These conditions can affect the body’s immune response and healing processes, potentially leading to an increased risk of complications.
Lastly, PLLA fillers are not recommended for patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding. It is crucial for individuals considering PLLA treatment to disclose any relevant medical history to their healthcare provider to ensure safe outcomes.
The Best Korean PLLA Filler Brands
In recent years, an array of PLLA filler brands has flooded the market. These brands, known for their innovation, efficacy, and safety profile, have become synonymous with excellence. However, navigating the diverse landscape of PLLA filler brands can be daunting. To help get you started, we will explore several key PLLA filler brands and shed light on why they may be the optimal choice for one’s aesthetic goals.
1. Juvelook PLLA Filler
Juvelook PLLA filler offers a unique blend of immediate filling effects and long-term collagen stimulation. With a concentration of 42.5 mg of poly D,L lactide and 7.5 mg of non-cross-linked hyaluronic acid, Juvelook PLLA filler delivers unparalleled results.
Unlike traditional fillers, Juvelook PLLA filler eliminates the need for post-treatment massage, courtesy of the round shape of its PDLLA acid molecules and its combination with non-cross-linked hyaluronic acid. The effects of the treatment are visible immediately after injection, offering a filling effect through hyaluronic acid (HA). After about two weeks post-treatment, collagen production is initiated by the presence of PDLLA lactic acid microparticles, leading to improvements in skin texture and elasticity.
The durability of Juvelook PLLA filler treatments is also noteworthy, as they are known to last over 24 months. With recommended treatment intervals of 6–8 weeks, Juvelook PLLA filler offers flexibility tailored to individual skin concerns. Whether targeting the lower eyelid, crow’s feet, tear valley, forehead, or engaging in mesotherapy for the face, neck, or neckline, Juvelook PLLA filler is an optimal choice.
Juvelook PLLA filler is not only distinguished by its efficacy but also by its ease of use and comfort during administration. With a hybrid formula of Poly D,L Lactide, and HA particles ranging from 10 to 40 micrometers, Juvelook PLLA filler ensures easy injection and prevents needle clogging during procedures. Backed by FDA and CE certifications for polylactic acid, as well as patents and clinical trials, Juvelook PLLA filler offers practitioners and patients confidence.
2. Mennus PLLA Filler
Manufactured by MayPharm in South Korea, Mennus PLLA fillers represent a breakthrough in long-term neocollagenesis. Mennus offers sustained volumization and natural rejuvenation that lasts over a year and a half. This innovative filler is composed of PLA and CMC (carboxymethyl cellulose), delivering immediate volume while continuously stimulating collagen regeneration for enduring results.
As a next-generation biotechnology research company, MayPharm focuses on the convergence and integration of biomaterials, pharmaceuticals, and devices to provide innovative beauty solutions. With a commitment to promoting healthy living, Mennus PLLA fillers are just one cosmetic procedure that contributes to the medical aesthetic and derma care industries.
One of the distinguishing features of Mennus PLLA fillers is their perfectly spherical shape and uniform particle size, which ensure low injection power and reduced treatment time. By applying Reanzen’s freeze-drying technology, Mennus PLLA fillers achieve quick suspension without leaving residue in the body, thanks to their biodegradable materials. This makes Mennus an ideal choice for individuals in their 30s to 50s who are concerned about aging, fine wrinkles, and skin elasticity, as well as those with sensitive or dry skin from external factors.
